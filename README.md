# Spotify New Music Browser
Live App: https://dpbates13.github.io/Spotify-New-Music-Browser/

This website allows you to find albums released on Spotify that don't
show up on Spotify's New Releases page. It also sorts them by genre, so
that you don't have to waste time looking through music that doesn't
interest you.
